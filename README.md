# Property Flow

**Property Flow** is a full-featured property management system designed to handle the **entire lifecycle of properties** â€” from listings and tenant inquiries, to bookings, applications, lease management, and beyond. The platform is built to streamline property operations for **landlords, agents, tenants, and administrators**, while providing a seamless experience for prospective and current tenants. Although it starts with rental management, it is designed to support **future extensions for property sales, payments, maintenance, and utility tracking**.
